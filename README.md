## Main Functionality:
* User can spawn a furniture item into a room.
* Spawned furniture can be repositioned and resized.
* Unwanted furniture can be removed by throwing it out of the room.

## How MRTK3 is used:
* The app is targeted for Meta Quest 2 using hand sensors (not the regular controllers).
* Once the app is loaded and the hands are detected, the player can activate the furniture menu by facing their palms facing upward and shaking them.
* Once the furniture menu is toggled, a scrollable menu pops up and any furniture item can be spawned by clicking the 'Place it' button.

## Upcoming Features:
* Removing furniture by toggling a button
* Resetting the room by removing all the furniture
* Making a purchase
* More realistic room scenes and actually available furniture items
* More room layout and furniture items with different colors
* Stock availability check based on the size of the furniture
* Saving the project so the user can continue working on it later
